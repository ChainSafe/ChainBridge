# Handlers

This is aimed at Ethereum, although the concept can be replicated on a different chain of choice. When a deposit is received by the Receiver, the actual asset and any necessary parameters will be in the form of a byte array. To finish the transfer, the byte array needs to be unpacked in order to perform any operations. The unpacking would take place via a handler function. A handler function should be created for specific use cases, for example a token transfer and arbitrary call data transfer would each have their own respective handler function. A handler function (or a handler smart contract) must contain one function, executeTransfer(bytes _data), this function is responsible for taking the incoming data and manipulating as it sees fit. This allows the bridge entry point (eg: smart contract) for a given chain to be generic. If this isn't exactly possible for a specific blockchain, remember the goal is that anyone can create their own handler, and interact with the bridge. It should follow a modular design.
