# Forte Bridge Relayer
The Forte Bridge Relayer is a Multi-Directional Blockchain Bridge that interacts with
multiple chains; Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Substrate, Custodial Aleo based chains.

## Software Setup
* [GO](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Local Development

### Local Environment 
Make a copy of `.env.example` and name it `.env` within the `ChainBridge` directory.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Environment variables that need to come from Secrets are marked # TODO: Move to Secrets Storage


### Local Build and Setup

To build and set up the local environment, run the following commands.

```bash
make get
make build
make install
```

Once you have run the above command, you can run your local build of chainbridge.
However, additional configuration is required to deploy contracts and generate a configuration file.
See [forte_bridge_devops](https://github.com/fortelabsinc/forte_bridge_devops) for instructions on deploying contracts
and creating local configuration file.

### ChainBrdige Commands

* Show a list of useful commands

  ```bash
  make help
  # Alternative
  make
  ```

* Generate Keystore files Using a Private Key

    *Generate needed keystore files for the relayer contracts Private Keys*
    ```bash
      ./build/chainbridge accounts import --privateKey "${Your Private Key Here}"
    ```

This command requires a properly configured json file in `./config/config.json` and a configured keystore in
`./keys`. Make sure you have moved the files you generated in [forte_bridge_devops](https://github.com/fortelabsinc/forte_bridge_devops) 
to the local directory for running the relayer here. See [forte_bridge_devops](https://github.com/fortelabsinc/forte_bridge_devops) 
for instructions on deploying contracts and creating the configuration file.

If using the Aleo Custodian. Make sure it is running on Localhost and the ports specified in the `config.json`
file.

* Run ChainBridge Relayer

  *Run ChainBridge Relayer*
  ```bash
  make start
  # Alternative
  ./build/chainbridge --config config/config.json --verbosity trace --latest
  ```
