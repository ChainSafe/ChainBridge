[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge)

A Modular Multi-Directional Blockchain Bridge to interact with Multiple Networks; Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Substrate, Cosmos-SDK based chains.


# Relevant repos

## Ethereum
 Ethereum (Solidity): [chainbridge-solidity](https://github.com/ChainSafe/chainbridge-solidity) 

 The Solidity contracts required for chainbridge. Includes deployment and interaction CLI.
    
 The bindings for the contracts live in `bindings/`. To update the bindings modify `scripts/setup-contracts.sh` and then run `make clean && make setup-contracts`

## Substrate
Substrate: [chainbridge-substrate](https://github.com/ChainSafe/chainbridge-substrate)

A substrate pallet that can be integrated into a chain, as well as an example pallet to demonstrate chain integration.
