# Chain Implementations
 Ethereum (Solidity): [chainbridge-solidity](https://github.com/ChainSafe/chainbridge-solidity) 

    The Solidity contracts required for chainbridge. Includes deployment and interaction CLI.
    
    The bindings for the contracts live in `bindings/`. To update the bindings modify `scripts/setup-contracts.sh` and then run `make clean && make setup-contracts`
